The recreateGhariniInputs file reads the kinematic data from the Winter data (Excel files) and fits 8-term Fourier series to each joint
angle profile. The time values are then normalized as a percentage of a full gait cycle.

The coefficients for each term in the Fourier series are saved in the CoeffsAsPctGC file.
