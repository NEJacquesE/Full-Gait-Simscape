 SIMSCAPE MULTIBODY

Completion of gait cycle
	Are the hips trans. coor. part of the gen. coor. needed for Inv. Kinematics?
	If so how do I input them?
		Using some initial position and providing vel. and acc. to find pose. profile
	How do I input the grfs?
		Seem to be doing forward kinematics not Inv. Kinematics
		Should it be what's done? Considering all unkn. in the sys.

Ok could be useful still has to be done

Kinematics analysis to see foot displacement

Starting with the hip
